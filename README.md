## Installation

You can get this extension directly from the following appstores:
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proscommunity/enhiiphhfepbplldgecjgcmjoocaaipj?hl=en-GB&authuser=0)
- [Firefox Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/proscommunity/)

## Developer Installation

Browser extensions are simple zip files. A `build_release.cmd` script is provided, but it assumes that:
- you are on Windows
- 7-Zip is installed at C:\Program Files\7-Zip

You can execute it like this:
```
build_release.cmd chrome proscommunity_16
```
It will produce a chrome_proscommunity_16.zip file in the same directory.

You will then have to install it in your browser.
